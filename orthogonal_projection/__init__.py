"""
OrthoReduce: Dimensionality Reduction with Orthogonal Projections

This package provides various dimensionality reduction techniques including:
- Johnson-Lindenstrauss random projections
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- UMAP (optional)
- Geometric embeddings (Poincar√©, Spherical)
- Convex hull projections

Main Interface:
- For full functionality, import from dimensionality_reduction
- For simplified interface, import from pipeline
- For basic projections, import from projection
- For evaluation metrics, import from evaluation
