# Advanced Spherical Embeddings Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the mathematically rigorous improvements made to spherical embeddings in the OrthoReduce dimensionality reduction library. The improvements focus on proper Riemannian geometry, numerical stability, and optimization techniques specifically designed for the sphere manifold.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Geodesic Distance Computations

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Geodesic distance on sphere S^(k-1) with radius r: `d_geo(x,y) = r * arccos(⟨x,y⟩/r²)`
- Handles numerical stability near antipodal points using clipping: `arccos(clip(dot_product, -0.9999999, 0.9999999))`
- Efficient batch computation for all pairwise distances

**Implementation Features:**
- Single pair and batch geodesic distance functions
- Automatic handling of different sphere radii  
- Numerical safeguards for edge cases (identical points, antipodal points)
- Triangle inequality preservation verification

**Code Example:**
```python
from orthogonal_projection.spherical_embeddings import SphericalEmbedding

# Compute geodesic distance between two points
d = SphericalEmbedding.geodesic_distance(x, y, radius=1.0)

# Batch computation for efficiency
D = SphericalEmbedding.geodesic_distance_batch(X, radius=1.0)
```

### 2. Riemannian Optimization Framework

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Tangent space at x: `T_x S^(k-1) = {v ∈ ℝ^k : ⟨x,v⟩ = 0}`
- Exponential map: `Exp_x(v) = cos(‖v‖/r)x + r sin(‖v‖/r)v/‖v‖`
- Logarithmic map: `Log_x(y) = (rθ/sin(θ))(y/r - cos(θ)x/r)` where `θ = arccos(⟨x,y⟩/r²)`

**Implementation Features:**
- Tangent space projection operators
- Exponential map retractions to maintain sphere constraints
- Logarithmic map for inverse operations
- Riemannian gradient descent with proper manifold structure

**Key Functions:**
- `project_to_tangent_space()`: Projects vectors to tangent space
- `exponential_map()`: Retracts tangent vectors back to sphere
- `logarithmic_map()`: Maps sphere points to tangent vectors

### 3. Geometry-Consistent Loss Functions

**Available Loss Types:**

1. **MDS Stress on Geodesic Distances:**
   ```
   L = Σᵢⱼ wᵢⱼ(d_geo(yᵢ,yⱼ) - dᵢⱼ)²
   ```
   - Uses geodesic distances instead of Euclidean
   - Inverse distance weighting for stability

2. **Triplet Loss:**
   ```
   L = Σ max(0, d_geo(yᵢ,yⱼ) - d_geo(yᵢ,yₖ) + margin)
   ```
   - Preserves relative distance orderings
   - Adaptive margin based on sphere radius

3. **Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA):**
   ```
   L = -Σᵢ log(Σⱼ∈Cᵢ pᵢⱼ)
   ```
   - Uses geodesic distances in probability computation
   - Encourages same-class points to be close on sphere

4. **Hybrid Loss:**
   - Combines MDS (70%) and NCA (30%) losses
   - Balances distance preservation with clustering

### 4. Curvature and Radius Adaptation

**Adaptive Radius Optimization:**
- Golden section search to find optimal sphere radius
- Minimizes MDS stress as objective function
- Range: [0.1, 10.0] with tolerance 1e-3

**Hemisphere Enforcement:**
- Prevents antipodal ambiguity by constraining to hemisphere
- Automatically flips embeddings if too many points in negative hemisphere
- Maintains consistent orientation during optimization

**Implementation:**
```python
# Enable adaptive radius optimization
Y, info = adaptive_spherical_embedding(
    X, k=3,
    adaptive_radius=True,
    hemisphere_constraint=True
)
print(f"Optimal radius: {info['final_radius']}")
```

## Integration with Main Library

### Enhanced `run_spherical()` Function

The main spherical embedding function now supports:
- **Riemannian optimization**: Full manifold-aware optimization
- **Fast approximation**: PCA + adaptive radius for large datasets  
- **Simple method**: Basic PCA + normalization for compatibility

```python
from orthogonal_projection.dimensionality_reduction import run_spherical

# Advanced Riemannian optimization
Y, runtime = run_spherical(
    X, k=3,
    use_riemannian=True,
    adaptive_radius=True,
    loss_type='mds_geodesic'
)
```

### Evaluation Metrics
